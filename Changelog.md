	 - Start fetching the target from the next cycle on branch misprediction
	 - Load for non-word quantities (byte and half-word) take an extra one cycle on cache-hit
	 - Add function to invalidate entries in mem_request_queue on the miss-speculated path
- Changed
	 - Re-factor and modularize simulator code-base
	 - STORE type instructions submit write-request to L1-data cache and exit memory stage in a single cycle
	 - Delay for reading/writing page-table entries is now simulated via L1-Data cache
	 - Print IPC for all the RISC-V CPU modes after simulation completes to the console and log file
	 - In-order core doesn't support parallel execution in multiple functional units
	 - Replace hot-cold LRU eviction policy with bit-PLRU eviction policy for BTB and caches
	 - Improve the format of TinyEMU config file
	 - Update [MARSS-RISCV Docs](https://marss-riscv-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
	 - Update README.md
	 - Page walk delays are simulated via L1 D$
	 - Removed [DRAMsim2](https://github.com/umd-memsys/DRAMSim2) support
 - Fixed
	 - Memory leaks
	 - Don't start simulating DRAM access delay until cache lookup delay is simulated

# Version 3.1a

 - Added
	 - Print TLB stats to the terminal after the simulation completes
	 - Specify latency for each FPU ALU instruction (`fadd`, `fsub`, `fmul`, `fdiv`, `fmin`, `fmax`, `fcvt`, `cvt`, `fle`, `flt`, `feq`, `fsgnj`, `fqsrt`, `fmv`, `fclass`) via TinyEMU config file 
	 - Figure showing the high-level overview of MARSS-RISCV in README.md 
- Changed
	 - Simplify the base DRAM model
		 - All memory accesses simulate a fixed latency `mem_access_latency`
		 - Any subsequent accesses to the same physical page occupies a lower delay, which is roughly 60 percent of the fixed `mem_access_latency`
		 - More info [here](https://marss-riscv-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
	 - Parallel operation of functional units can be enabled or disabled in the in-order core via TinyEMU config file
	 - Clean exception handling code
	 - Simulate page table entry read/write delays directly via memory controller using a configurable fixed latency `pte_rw_latency`
	 - Don't stall the pipeline stage for the write request to complete on the memory controller
	 - Make FPU-ALU non-pipelined
	 - Rename `dram_dispatch_queue` to`mem_request_queue`
	 - Update [MARSS-RISCV Docs](https://marss-riscv-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
	 - Update README.md
	 - Update TinyEMU config file [here](https://cs.binghamton.edu/~marss-riscv/marss-riscv-images.tar.gz)
 - Fixed
	 - memory leaks

# Version 3.0a

 - Added
	 - Support for separate RISC-V Bios and Kernel
	 - Command line option `flush-sim-mem` to flush simulator memory hierarchy on every fresh simulation run
	 - Command line option `sim-trace` to generate instruction commit trace during simulation
	 - Distinct configurable read-hit and write-hit latency for all the caches
	 - Return address stack (RAS)
	 - Branch prediction and speculative execution support for out of order core
	 - Print performance counters on terminal when the simulation completes
	 - More performance counters:
		 - Instruction types
		 - ecall
		 - page walks for loads, stores and instructions
		 - memory controller delay for data and instructions
		 - hardware interrupts
 - Changed
	 - Port to TinyEMU version `2019-12-21`
	 - For bimodal branch predictor, store prediction bits in a separate Branch history table (BHT)
	 - For in-order core, non-memory instructions can forward their result from MEM stage in addition to EX stage
	 - For in-order core, relaxed interlocking on WAW data hazard
	 - Simplified out of order core design, ROB slots are now used as physical registers along with a single rename table and a single global issue queue
 - Fixed
	 - Correctly calculated the rounding mode for floating pointing instruction decoding
	 - Converted `c.addiw` result buffer into `int32_t` on 64-bit simulation
	 - Set the data type to `unint64_t` for 64-bit simulation, for the buffer which holds the memory address for atomic instructions
	 - Issue #13 and #14 (thanks to Okhotnikov Grigory)
